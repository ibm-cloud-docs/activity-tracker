# Understanding observability (WIP)
{: #observability-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} provides services that log and monitor activity in your accounts to help you understand the activity in your account and maintain records for auditing and compliance.
{: shortdesc}


{{../log-analysis/_include-segments/deprecation_notice.md}}

## What is observability?
{: #observability}

As a user of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} you might need to understand the following for the services you are running:

* The actions that are being taken by services running in your account. For example, if a new user is authorized to use a service.

* Any log entries that are posted while a service is being run. For example, if a service generates a log entry indicating a connection error.

* The health and performance of your service instances. For example, if you are approaching memory limits.

* If your services are compliant with required security standards and policies. For example, if your services have any known security vulnerabilities.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides the following services, also known as logging and monitoring services, that will help you with your observability requirements:

* {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}
* {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}
* {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}

## What is activity tracking?
{: #at-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} provides the ability to collect auditing events for enabled {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.  Some services might require a service plan upgrade or configuration setting changes to enable event tracking.

Auditing events can help you investigate abnormal activity and critical actions.  Event tracking can help you comply with regulatory audit requirements since the events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.

There are two types of events:

Location-based
:   Location-based events are events that are associated with services running in a particular {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region.

Global
:   Global events are events generated by services that provide services for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} as a whole. An example of a service that generates global events is {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}}.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} has two different options depending on your requirements.

* {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} is required for environments needing to maintain Financial Services (FS) validation status.

* {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search is used if you need to comply with PCI, SOC2, Privacy Shield, and HIPAA requirements.

Where you can route events is dependent on the option you select:

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search
:   Location-based events are routed to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search instance in the region where they are generated and global events are routed to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search instance provisioned in Frankfurt (`eu-de`). If you want to consolidate events into a single instance you can configure special routing to route events from the instance initially collecting the events to your desired {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search instance.

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}
:   Events are routed based on a field value included in the event. You can define a set of routes, targets, and rules to determine where the events will be sent and stored. Events can be routed to a {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search instance, a {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket, or {{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}}.

For compliance purposes you might have to maintain your data within a particular country or region.
{: important}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search also provides a dashboard allowing you to filter, view, create customer views and search events within an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search instance. You can also set up alerts based on your defined criteria.

Each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service documents the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} events that it collects.  See [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search events](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-cloud_services) and [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} events](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-cloud_services_atracker) for information on the services sending events and the events that are sent.

## What is logging?
{: #log-overview}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} to manage operating system logs, application logs, and platform logs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers advanced features to view, filter, search, and tail log data, define alerts, and design custom views to monitor logs.

Platform logs are logs generated by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. These logs can be sent to only one {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance in a region.
{: note}

Each service documents the logs that it sends to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}.  See [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that generate {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-cloud_services) for information on the services sending logs and the type of logs that are sent.

Logs are sent to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} in the region where the service is located. Logs can be routed from a {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance to a different {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} if you want to consolidate all your log information into a single {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance.

For compliance purposes you might have to maintain your data within a particular country or region.
{: important}

## What is monitoring?
{: #mon-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} provides dashboards that allow you to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services and platforms. You can monitor and troubleshoot issues and define alerts based on specific operational criteria.  You can also create custom dashboards to meet your organization's needs.

Each service documents the metrics that it sends to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}.  See [Service generating metrics](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-cloud_services) for information on the services sending metrics and the type of metrics that are sent.

## What is compliance?
{: #compliance-overview}

Many governments, companies and industries have specific requirements for auditing and security. These can include ensuring production systems are not running software with known security vulnerabilities. Requirements can also include requirements for environments to be running in a Financial Services Validated status or in compliance with regulations such as PCI, SOC2, Privacy Shield, and HIPAA.

Several {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services can help you maintain compliance.

* {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} can be used for environments needing to maintain Financial Services (FS) validation status.

* {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search can be used if you need to comply with PCI, SOC2, Privacy Shield, and HIPAA requirements.

* {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} Secure provides the services [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](#mon-overview) with the ability to scan containers or microservice pipelines and runtime components for security vulnerabilities.  This give you the ability to monitor the health and performance of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment along with the ability to scan for potential security issues.

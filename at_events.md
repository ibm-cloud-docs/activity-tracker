# Auditing events for {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}


{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} automatically generates events so that you can track activity on your service instance.

## CADF standard
{: #cadf_standard}

The CADF standard defines a full event model that includes the information that is needed to certify, manage, and audit security of applications and services in cloud environments. The CADF event model includes the following components:
-	Action: The action is the operation or activity that an initiator performs, attempts to perform, or is waiting to complete.
-	Initiator: The initiator is the resource that makes an API call and generates a CADF event. The event that is triggered depends on the action that is requested by the API call.
-	Observer: The observer is the resource that creates and stores a CADF record from information available in a CADF event
-	Outcome: The outcome is the status of the action against the target.
-	Target: The target is the resource against which the action is performed, attempted to perform, or is pending to complete.

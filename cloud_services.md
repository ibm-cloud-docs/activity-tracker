{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (COS) generates global, management, and data events.
* By default, events that report on global actions such as the creation of a bucket are collected automatically. You can monitor these events through the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance that is located in the Frankfurt location.
* Collection of management and data events in your account is optional.
* **You must configure each bucket to enable management events, or management and data events.** Notice that you cannot enable data events only for a bucket.

    * To monitor management events, you must configure a bucket and specify the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance where those events will be available for monitoring.
    * To monitor data events, you must select the option **Track data events** when you associate a bucket with an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance.

{{site.data.keyword.mdms_short}} generates global events only, for each transition of the order state.

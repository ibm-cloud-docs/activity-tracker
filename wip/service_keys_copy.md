# Managing service keys
{: #service_keys}

In an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance you can create, delete, and view auditing service keys by using the UI.  You can also create and view auditing service keys by using the CLI and API.
{: shortdesc}



A service key is a unique code that is passed in an API request to identify the calling application or user.

You must use an auditing service key to complete any of the following tasks:
- Export data programmatically
- Manage views and alerts programmatically by using the Configuration API or Terraform.

You can enable a maximum of 20 auditing service keys for each auditing instance.  To create more than one auditing service key, you have to add additional service keys by using the UI.  You can only create one auditing service key by using the API or CLI.
{: important}

If an auditing service key does not exist, the first API command sent to {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} will automatically generate a service key.
{: note}



## Prereqs. Check your IAM permissions to manage service keys
{: #service_keys_prereq}

To generate a new service key or get an existing service key, you need the following roles on the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}:
- Platform role `operator`, `editor` or `administrator`
- Service role `Manager`

To restrict access to a service key, you need the following role on the `IAM Identity Service service`:
- Platform role `Administrator`



## Managing service keys by using the UI
{: #service_keys_ui}

You can create, delete, and view service keys by using the UI.

### Creating a service key by using the UI

## Managing a service key by using the CLI
{: #service_keys_cli}

You can create and view service keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI.

### Creating a service key by using the CLI
{: #service_keys_cli_create}

Only a single auditing service key can be created by using the CLI.  Using these commands to create a service key where one already exists will not create a new key.  If you need to create more than one auditing service key, use the [UI](#service_keys_ui).
{: important}

To create an auditing service key for a auditing instance through the command line, complete the following steps:

1. [Pre-requisite] [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

2. Log in to the region in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} where the auditing instance is running. Run the following command: [ibmcloud login](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login)

3. Set the resource group where the auditing instance is running. Run the following command: [ibmcloud target](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_target)

    By default, the `default` resource group is set.

4. Get the instance name. Run the following command: [ibmcloud resource service-instances](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_instances)

    ```text
    ibmcloud resource service-instances
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Create the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key. Run the [ibmcloud resource service-key-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_key_create) command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud resource service-key-create <NAME> --instance-name <SERVICE_INSTANCE>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Where NAME is the desired name of the service key and SERVICE_INSTANCE is the name of the service instance from the previous step.

    The output from this command includes the field **service_key** that contains the service key for the instance.

6. Restrict access to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key so that only users that have the `administrator` and `manager` roles can see information associated with the service key.

    Identify the service ID associated with the service that you created in the previous step. Run the following command to list all the service IDs that are available in the resource group:

    ```text
    ibmcloud iam service-ids
    ```
    {: pre}

    The **ID** column indicates the `SERVICE_ID` that is associated with the service key that you created in the previous step.

    Identify the auditing instance ID. Run the following command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud resource service-instance <AUDITING_INSTANCE_NAME>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Then, create a policy to restrict access to the service key:

    ```text
    ibmcloud iam service-policy-create <SERVICE_ID> --roles Administrator,Manager --service-name logdnaat --service-instance <AUDITING_INSTANCE_ID]
    ```
    {: pre}


Consider deleting the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key. There is a limit on the number of service IDs per account. For more information, see [IBM Cloud IAM limits](/docs/account?topic=account-known-issues&interface=cli#iam_limits).
{: tip}

To delete a service key, run the following command:

```text
ibmcloud resource service-key-delete <NAME>
```
{: pre}



### Getting the service key by using the CLI
{: #service_keys_cli_get}


To get the service key through the command line, complete the following steps:

1. [Pre-requisite] [Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

2. Log in to the region in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} where the auditing instance is running. Run the following command: [ibmcloud login](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login)

3. Set the resource group where the auditing instance is running. Run the following command: [ibmcloud target](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_target)

    By default, the `default` resource group is set.

4. Get the instance name. Run the following command: [ibmcloud resource service-instances](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_instances)

    ```text
    ibmcloud resource service-instances
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Get the name of the key that is associated with the auditing instance. Run the [ibmcloud resource service-keys](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_keys) command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud resource service-keys --instance-name <INSTANCE_NAME>
    ```
    {: pre}

    where `INSTANCE_NAME` is the name of the instance that you obtained in the previous step.

6. Get the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key. Run the [ibmcloud resource service-key](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_key) command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud resource service-key <KEY_NAME>
    ```
    {: pre}

    where KEY_NAME is the name of the key obtained in the previous step.

    The output from this command includes the field **service_key** that contains a service key for the instance.  If no service key has been created for the instance, or, if you do not have **manager** access, no service key will be returned.



## Managing a service key by using the API
{: #service_keys_api}

You can create and view service keys using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API.


### Creating a service key by using the API
{: #service_keys_api_create}

Only a single auditing service key can be created using the API.  Using the API to create a service key where one already exists will not create a new key.  If you need to create more than one service key, use the [UI](#service_keys_ui).
{: important}

To create the service key through the API, complete the following steps:

1. Generate an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=api#create_user_key).

2. Get an access token. For more information, see [Generating an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM token by using an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-iamtoken_from_apikey&interface=api).

    You need an IAM access token to authenticate in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    To generate an IAM access token, run the following command:

    ```text
    curl -X POST 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey=MY_APIKEY'
    ```
    {: pre}

    The access token is only valid for 1 hour. `access_token` includes the string "Bearer" followed by the IAM token.

3. Get the GUID of an IAM service key that is associated with the auditing instance.

    Get the list of resource instances:

    ```text
    curl -X GET   https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com/v2/resource_instances   -H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM token>"
    ```
    {: pre}

    Look for the `guid` field of the instance to get the instance GUID.

4. [Create the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#post-resource-key). Run the following cURL command:

    ```text
    curl -X POST https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com/v2/resource_keys -H "Authorization: $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"name":"<NAME>", "source":"<AUDITING_INSTANCE_GUID>"}'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Where `NAME` is the name to be given to the IAM service key and GUID is the auditing instance GUID obtained in the previous step.

5. Add a policy on the service ID that is associated with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key. For more information, see [Create a policy](/apidocs/iam-policy-management#create-policy).

6. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource service key. Run the following command:

    ```text
    curl -X DELETE https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com/v2/resource_keys/<IAM_SERVICE_KEY_GUID> -H "Authorization: $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    {: pre}

    There is a limit on the number of service IDs per account. For more information, see [IBM Cloud IAM limits](/docs/account?topic=account-known-issues&interface=cli#iam_limits).
    {: note}

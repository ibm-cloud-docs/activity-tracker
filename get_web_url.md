# Getting the UI URL
{: #get_web_url}

After you provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can view, monitor, and manage events through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI. You can launch the UI from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI or directly from a browser.
{: shortdesc}




To get the UI URL, complete the following steps from a terminal:

1. [Pre-requisite] Installation of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. [Learn more](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).

2. Log in to the location in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} where the instance is provisioned. Run the following command: [ibmcloud login](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login)

3. Set the resource group where the instance is available. Run the following command: [ibmcloud target](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_target)

    By default, the `default` resource group is set.

4. Get the dashboard URL. Run the following command:

    ```text
    ic resource service-instance INSTANCE_NAME --output JSON | grep dashboard_url
    ```
    {: codeblock}

Where *INSTANCE_NAME* is the name of the instance.

To get the name of the instances that are available in a resource group, you can run `ibmcloud resource service-instances`.

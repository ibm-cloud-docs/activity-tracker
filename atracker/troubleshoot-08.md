{: support}

When working with a target, for example, when validating a target using the `ibmcloud atracker target validate` command and specifying a target name for `--target`, the following message is returned: `Multiple targets were found with the same name - marisa-acc-bucket, use target id instead.`
{: shortdesc}


This information applies only if you use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} Event Routing.
{: important}


Your request fails with an error message that indicates you have more than one target defined with the same name.
{: tsSymptoms}

You have more than one target defined with the same name and {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} cannot identify the unique target when the target name is specified.

# Options to configure the account
{: #atracker-acc-config}

Learn how to configure your account to manage auditing events by using {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}}.
{: shortdesc}



## Configuring the account to collect events by using {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing
{: #atracker-acc-config-1}


To configure {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing in your account, you must define which locations auditing events are collected from and where are they routed and stored. You must configure 1 or more targets, and 1 or more routes. You must also configure the account settings. [Learn more](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started-routing-2).

- A target defines a resource where you can collect auditing events. For more information, see [Targets](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-atracker-resources&interface=cli#atracker-resources-targets).
- A route defines the rules that determine the targets where auditing events are routed to in your account. For more information, see [Routes](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-atracker-resources&interface=cli#atracker-resources-routes).

- The account settings configuration defines information such as default targets where events are collected in the account, types of endpoints that are allowed to manage the configuration, and allowed locations to store the data in the account. For more information, see [Account configuration settings](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-atracker-resources&interface=cli#atracker-resources-settings).

For each account, you can choose the regions where auditing events are collected.

You can only configure regions where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing is supported. See [Locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions&interface=cli#regions-atracker).


## Configuring the account to collect events by using the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search offering
{: #atracker-acc-config-2}

To configure {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search in your account, you must configure 1 or more {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instances. 

- You can provison only 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short} service for each location where {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search is available. 

    To get the list of locations where the service is available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions).

- To monitor activity in your account, you must provision the following {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instances:

   * 1 instance in Frankfurt to monitor global events
   * 1 instance in each region where you operate

   For more information, see [Provisioning an instance](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision).

For example, you might have services only in the `us-south` location. To monitor activity in your account, you need 1 instance in `us-south` to monitor events that are generated by services that are running in that location. You need 1 instance in `eu-de` (Frankfurt) to monitor global actions that happen in your account such as user management actions, and provisioning of service instances.

If all you services are in `eu-de`, only 1 instance is required in `eu-de` to manage both global and location-based events.
{: note}

To manage your {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instances, on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console you can click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) &gt; **Observability** &gt; **Activity Tracker** to see the dashboard where all the instances that are provisioned in the account are listed.

To monitor auditing events, choose an instance and click **Open dashboard**.


## Configuring the account to choose where to collect events
{: #atracker-acc-config-3}


To configure your account to manage auditing events and route them to the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance of your choice, you can combine the configuration of {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing with the configuration of {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search offering.

- You must configure 1 or more {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search instances in the account. These instances are the ones where you plan to send auditing events. In addition, you must provision 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search service for each location where you operate and {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing is [not supported](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions#regions-atracker). 

    You can provison only 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search service per location. To get the list of locations where the service is available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions).

- After you provision your account auditing instances, you must define 1 target definition for each {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance. 

    You can only define targets in supported {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing locations. [Learn more about supported locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions#regions-atracker).

- You must define 1 or more route definitions that indicate how to route events to those targets.

    You can only define routing rules for those regions where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing is supported. [Learn more about supported locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions#regions-atracker). 
    
    For all other regions, location-based events are routed to the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} hosted event search instance that is provisioned in that region in your account.

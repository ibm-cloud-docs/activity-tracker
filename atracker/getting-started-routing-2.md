{: #getting-started-routing-2}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="activity-tracker"} 
{: toc-completion-time="1h"} 


Use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} to collect auditing events that are generated by services in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. The events comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.
{: shortdesc}


This information applies only if you use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} Event Routing V2 API.
{: important}

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. 


## Scenarios
{: #getting-started-routing-2-scenarios}

You can define a Cloud Object Storage bucket as a target in any of the following situations:
- You need a solution to monitor the activity in your account that must be Financial Services Validated.
- You want to collect and store auditing events in a Cloud Object Storage bucket that is defined in a different account from the one that generates auditing events.

![Diagram showing a decision flowchart to help you understand if a Cloud Object Storage bucket, or an {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} hosted event search (logdna) target best meets your requirements.](/images/getting-started-flow-yesFS-noinacct.svg "Flowchart showing which target type is best for your requirements"){: caption="Figure 1. Which target type is best for your requirements" caption-side="bottom"}


## Prerequisites
{: #getting-started-routing-2-prereqs}

- Learn about {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing. For more information, see [About](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-atracker-resources).

- Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. For more information, see [Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

- Install the latest {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing CLI V2 plugin in your local system. See [Installing the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing CLI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-atracker-cli-config&interface=cli).

- You need a user ID that is a member, or an owner of, an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. To get an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} user ID, go to: [Create an account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.

- Your user ID needs **administrator platform permissions** to manage the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service. Contact the account owner. The account owner can grant another user access to the account for the purposes of managing user access, and managing account resources. [Learn more](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).



## Check your IAM permissions
{: #getting-started-routing-2-step1}
{: step}

**Every user that manages {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} configurations in your account must be assigned an access policy.** The policy determines what actions the user can perform. The allowable actions are customized and defined by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} as operations that are allowed to be performed on the service. The actions are then mapped to IAM user roles. [Learn more](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-iam).

Your user ID needs **account management permissions** to manage {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} configurations in the account.

Users must have the following [IAM roles](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources) to manage the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing account settings. 

| Role                      | Minimum scope  | Minimum required roles | Action         |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| `atracker.setting.get`    | Account        | `Administrator`  \n `Editor`  \n `Viewer`  \n `Operator` | Get setting information |
| `atracker.setting.update` | Account        | `Administrator`| Update settings |
{: caption="Table 1. Required IAM roles to manage the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing account settings." caption-side="top"}

Users must have the following [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} IAM roles](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources) to work with targets. Users with regional IAM scope will be limited to access targets in their authorized region.

| Role | Minimum scope | Minimum required roles | Action
| -------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `atracker.target.read` | Region | `Administrator`  \n `Editor`  \n `Viewer`  \n `Operator` | Read (view) information about a target |
| `atracker.target.create` | Region | `Administrator`  \n `Editor` | Create a target |
| `atracker.target.update` | Region | `Administrator`  \n `Editor` | Update a target |
| `atracker.target.delete` | Region | `Administrator`  \n `Editor` | Delete a target |
| `atracker.target.list` | Account | `Administrator`  \n `Editor`  \n `Viewer`  \n `Operator` | List all targets |
{: caption="Table 2. Required IAM roles}

Users must have the following [IAM roles](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources) to work with routes.

| Role | Minimum scope | Minimum required roles | Action
| -------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `atracker.route.read` | Account | `Administrator`  \n `Editor`  \n `Viewer`  \n `Operator` | Read (view) information about a route |
| `atracker.route.create` | Account | `Administrator`  \n `Editor` | Create a route |
| `atracker.route.update` | Account | `Administrator`  \n `Editor` | Update a route |
| `atracker.route.delete` | Account | `Administrator`  \n `Editor` | Delete a route |
| `atracker.route.list` | Account | `Administrator`  \n `Editor`  \n `Viewer`  \n `Operator` | List all routes |
{: caption="Table 3. Required IAM roles}

Choose one of the following options to grant your user permissions:
- [Using the console to assign access](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#console-acct-mgmt)
- [Using the CLI to assign access](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#using-the-cli-to-assign-access)
- [Using the API to assign access](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#api-acct-mgmt). 

Use the **serviceName** `atracker`.
{: note}


## Configure the account settings
{: #getting-started-routing-2-step2}
{: step}

The account settings configuration defines information such as default targets where events are collected in the account, type of endpoints that are allowed to manage the configuration, and allowed locations to store the data in the account. 

You must configure the account settings to define the following information at the account level:
1. The location in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account where the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing account configuration metadata is stored. 

    By metadata, we refer to the target,route,settings data that is available across the account in any region.

    You can choose any of the supported locations where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing is available. For more information, see [Locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions&interface=cli).

    Take into account any corporate or industry compliance requirements such as Financial Services Validated locations, or EU-managed regions.

2. The type of endpoints that are allowed to manage the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing account configuration in the account. 

    You can configure public endpoints, private endpoints, or both.

3. The locations where an account administrator can define targets to collect auditing events.

    You can choose any of the supported locations where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing is available. For more information, see [Locations](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions&interface=cli).
    
    Take into account any corporate or industry compliance requirements such as Financial Services Validated locations, or EU-managed regions.

4. 1 or more targets in the account that will collect auditing events from supported {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} Event Routing locations where you have not configured how you want to collect the auditing data. 

    If you define more than 1 target, all default targets get a copy of the auditing events that are not explicitly managed in the account's routing rules.
    {: note}

### Get information about your account settings
{: #getting-started-routing-2-step2-1}

Check the account configuration settings. Run the following command:

```text
ibmcloud atracker setting get
```
{: pre}

The following is an example of the output where no default or permitted targets have been set.

```text
Atracker settings
Metadata region primary:     []
Default targets:             []
Permitted target regions:    []
Private api endpoint only:   false
API version:                 2
```
{: codeblock}


### Define or update the metadata location
{: #getting-started-routing-2-step2-2}

Configure the location of the metadata. Run the following command:

```text
ibmcloud atracker setting update --metadata-region-primary REGION
```
{: pre}

Where REGION must be set to an [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} supported region](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions&interface=cli#regions-atracker).

For more information on how to update the account settings, see [Updating settings using the CLI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-settings&interface=cli#settings-update-cli).



## Configure a COS bucket
{: #getting-started-routing-3-step3}
{: step}


Auditing events that are collected in your account can be stored in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (COS) buckets.

When you configure {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}, you must define a target per region. The target defines the COS bucket where auditing events in that region are collected.

Before you create a bucket, consider the following information:
- You can create the bucket in any location. 
- You can only configure 1 bucket per target.
- You must not share a bucket to collect [location-based auditing events](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-event_types#event_types_location) from multiple regions.
- If you have regulatory and compliance requirements, check the locations where you can create a bucket. Then, if performance is critical, consider creating the COS bucket in the same region where the auditing events are generated.

For more information, see [Managing {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (COS) buckets](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-cos).

You can define a bucket in the ac count that generates the auditing events or in a different account. 
{: important}

Choose one of the following options to create a bucket:

| Action             | More info |

## Configuring service-to-service authorization
{: #getting-started-routing-step3}
{: step}

Configure service-to-service authorization to your COS bucket so you do not need to pass an API key when writing your encrypted data to the COS bucket.

The following steps show how to define service to service authorization when the COS bucket is available in a different account from where auditing events are generated:

You must complete these steps in the account where the COS bucket is available.
{: important}

1. [Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external} as the account owner that will be configuring {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} targets.

	After you log in with your user ID and password, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard opens.

2. Click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**.  **Manage access and users** is displayed.

3. Click **Authorizations**.

4. Click **Create**.

5. Select the **Source account**. Choose **Other account**. Then, enter the account ID for the source service. An account ID is a 32 character, unique account identifier.

6. For **Source service** select *Activity Tracker Event Routing* and for **How do you want to scope the access?** select *All resources*.

7. For **Target service** select *Cloud Object Storage* for **How do you want to scope the access?** select *Resources based on selected attributes*.

8. Select **Service instance** and **string equals** the name of your COS instance.

9. For **Service access** select **Object writer**.

10. Click **Authorize**.  Your new service-to-service authorization will be listed in the **Manage authorizations** view.

Alternately, you can create the service-to-service policy by running the following command:

```text
ibmcloud iam authorization-policy-create atracker cloud-object-storage "Object Writer"
```
{: pre}

You will only be able to authorize to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance using the UI. If you want to limit authorization to a specific {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket, you need to configure authorization using the [API](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-target_v2_cos&interface=cli#cos_s2s_api).
{: important}


## Create a target
{: #getting-started-routing-step5}
{: step}

After you create the bucket and configure the authorizartion method, you can configure a target. The target defines the COS bucket where auditing events will be routed.  

The region identifies the location from which the writing to the bucket will occur.  If you want events from all regions to flow to this one COS bucket, then you only require a single target to be defined.

To [create a target](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-target_v2_cos&interface=cli#target-create-cli-cos), run the following command:

```text
ibmcloud atracker target create --name <TARGET_NAME> --type cloud-object-storage --endpoint <COS_ENDPOINT> --target-crn <COS_TARGET_CRN> --bucket <BUCKET> --region <REGION> --service-to-service-enabled true
```
{: pre}

Where 

`--region <REGION>` 
:   Name of the region that will process the events, for example, `us-south` or `eu-gb`. If not specified, the region logged into, or targeted, will be used.

`--name <TARGET_NAME>`
:   The name to be given to the target.

`--endpoint <COS_ENDPOINT>`
:   The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} endpoint to be associated with the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket.

`--bucket <BUCKET>`
:    The name of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket to be associated with the target.

`--target-crn <COS_TARGET_CRN>`
:   The CRN of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} instance.

`--service-to-service-enabled`
:   Indicates if [service-to-service authorization](#getting-started-routing-step3) has been enabled for the bucket.  Specify `TRUE` if service-to-service authorization is enabled and `FALSE` if service-to-service authorization is not enable.  

For example, to create a target in the US-South region, you can run the following command:

```text
ibmcloud atracker target create --name  "My target" --type cloud-object-storage --endpoint "s3.private.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud" --target-crn "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/<AccountID>:<COSinstanceID>::" --bucket "activity-tracking-bucket-us-south" --region "us-south" --service-to-service-enabled true
```
{: pre}

To see the target definition in a region, see [Getting information about a target using the CLI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-target_v2_cos&interface=cli#target-get-cli-cos).

When your target is created the target ID is returned. Make note of the target ID. You will need the target ID in the next step.
{: note}

## Define a route
{: #getting-started-routing-step6}
{: step}

After you have configured the target, you must configure the route to specify the rules that define how auditing events are routed in the account.

Define 1 or more routes in the account. For more information, see [Configuring a route](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-route_v2&interface=cli#route-create-cli).

When you configure a route, you define 1 or more rotuing rules that associate 1 or more targets with the route and define which type of auditing events are collected. The route defines the rules that determine where auditing events are routed in your account. For example, you can define a route that manages auditing events from 2 different regions, and also manages global events.

You can collect [global events](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-event_types#event_types_global) and [location-based events](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-event_types#event_types_location). 
- Global events report on activity in your account that relate to data and resources that are generally synchronized across all regions. 
- Location-based events report on activity in your account that is generated by IBM Cloud services that are hosted within an IBM data centre location, like US-South or US-East. 

In this step, you will configure a route to redirect all regional and global events to the target bucket that is configured in the previous step.

Run the following command to create the route:

```text
ibmcloud atracker route create --name <ROUTE_NAME> --rules 
```
{: pre}

Where

`--name <ROUTE_NAME>`
:   The name to be given to the route.

`--rules <ROUTING_RULES>`
:   A JSON formatted rule definition enclosed in single quotes. For example:

    ```json
    --rules '[{"locations":["global"],"target_ids":["11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"]},{"locations":["us-south","us-east"],"target_ids":["22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222","33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"]}]'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

For example, to create a route to send auditing events to the target created in the previous step, run the following command.

```text
ibmcloud atracker route create --name "my-route" --rules '[{"locations":["global","eu-de"],"target_ids":["281f78a2-d83f-430a-905e-e896f03cb403"]}]'
```
{: pre}

## Verify collection of events
{: #getting-started-routing-step7}
{: step}

After the target and the route is configured, you must verify that auditing events are available in your bucket.

Auditing events are stored in log files in the bucket.

Log files are structured and named as follows:

```text
<REGION>/<DATE>T<HOUR>/2021-02-23T15:38+05.log
```
{: codeblock}

Where

- `<REGION>` defines the region from where auditing events are collected. For example, valid values are `us-south` and `us-east`.
- `<DATE>` defines the date when auditing events are collected. The format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `<HOUR>` defines the hour of the day. The value is set by using a 24-hour clock.
- `<FILENAME>` defines a timestamp. The format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM+SS`. 

Each log file includes auditing events that have an `eventTime` that maps the filename timestamp. `eventTime` indicates when the auditing event was generated.

For example, a sample log file that collects auditing events in the US-South region looks as follows:

```text
us-south/2021-02-23T15/2021-02-23T15:38+05.log
```
{: screen}


You can choose any of the following methods to list objects in a bucket:
- [List objects in a given bucket by using the CLI](/docs/cloud-object-storage-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-object-storage-cli-plugin-ic-cos-cli#ic-list-objects).
- [List objects in a given bucket by using the API](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api-bucket-operations#compatibility-api-list-objects-v2)
- [List objects in a given bucket through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-cos#cos_bucket_list_objects_ui).

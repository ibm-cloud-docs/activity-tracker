# Terraform changes required after migrating to the V2 API (WIP)
{: #terraform-migrate}

After you have migrated to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} Event Routing V2 API you will need to make changes to your **LogDNA Terraform provider** configuration.
{: shortdesc}

This information applies only if you use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} Event Routing.
{: important}

These instructions assume you have an {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} Event Routing instance that you have provisioned using Terraform prior to the availability of the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} Event Routing V2 API.

Once you have [migrated to the V2 API](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-migrate-resources) you will need to follow these instructions to update your Terraform configuration.
